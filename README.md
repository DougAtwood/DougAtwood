<h1>Hello there!</h1>

<P>My name is Doug. I am a all around computer geek. I love learning about various topics such as: DevOps, computer hardware, automation, 3D modeling, animation, and photography. <br> With DevOps, I have learned HTML5 and CSS3, PHP, Java, JavaScript, C#, SQL, Python PowerShell, and CmdlinePrompt. <br> My last job, I got to be a Systems Administrator for a local MSP that did a lot of computer and networking infustructure for several small bussinesses. I was wanting to help them automate most of their processes to free up some needeed man power. I was able to automate some things with scripting and group policies.  </P>

<P>C# is what I've gravitaty towards as of late. <br>Been using Blender3D for modeling and animation. Feel free to checkout my instagram page  <a href=https://www.instagram.com/dougie3ddesign/?hl=en>here</a>
